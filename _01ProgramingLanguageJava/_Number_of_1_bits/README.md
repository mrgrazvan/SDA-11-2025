# Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer `n` and returns the number of `'1'` bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

This function should count how many bits are set to `1` in the binary representation of the input number.

## Example 1

**Input:**
```
n = 11
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
The binary representation of `11` is `00000000000000000000000000001011`, which has **three** bits set to `1`.

---

## Example 2

**Input:**
```
n = 128
```
**Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation:**
`128` in binary is `00000000000000000000000010000000` â†’ exactly one `1` bit.
